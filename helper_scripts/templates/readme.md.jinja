# üîì Custom firmware for Telink Tuya switches

Feature-rich custom firmware for Telink-based Tuya switches / switch-modules.  
Code is based on pvvx's [ZigbeeTLc](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc) firmware, huge thanks!

## üîå Supported devices

Note that rebranded versions may have different internals, requiring different pinouts (and therefore custom builds).  
"Zigbee Manufacturer" is the most reliable device identifier.

| Z2M device name | Vendor name | Zigbee Manufacturer | Type | Status | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{% for device in devices %}
| [{{device.z2m_device}}](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/{{device.z2m_device}}.html) | {{device.human_name}}  | {{device.tuya_manufacturer_name}} | {{ device.device_types | join(' / ') }} | {{device.status}} |  {% if device.github_issue %} [link]({{device.github_issue}}) {% else %}  - {% endif%} | 
{% endfor %}

If you device is not supported, but it is some Tuya switch module, please check: [porting_to_new_device.md](./docs/porting_to_new_device.md)

## ü§î Why?

The main driver for this project was a **frustrating bug in the factory firmware**:  
> When you pressed one button, the device ignored input from the others for ~0.5 seconds. As a result, pressing two buttons simultaneously toggled a single relay.

Users also consider this *the missing piece of a reliable smart home* because it allows **using a light switch as a Zigbee remote**.  
(There are no switches on the market that allow binding **to** other devices out-of-the-box.) 

## ‚ú® Features

- **Super fast reaction time** (compared to stock firmware)
- **Outgoing binds** (use switch to remotely control Zigbee lightbulbs - state & brightness)
- Configurable **Long press** for push-switches (custom action & duration)
- Both **Router** & **EndDevice** modes for no-Neutral devices
- **Detached mode** (generate Zigbee events without triggering relays)
- **Power-on behavior** (on, off, previous, toggle)
- Multiple **reset options** (5x switch press, on-board button)
- Custom **switch action modes**, allowing to synchonize switch position or binded devices with relay state

## üì≤ Flashing

The firmware can be installed:
- wirelessly on Z2M: [ota_flash.md](./docs/ota_flash.md) (recommended)
- wirelessly on old Z2M: [ota_flash_z2m_v1.md](./docs/ota_flash_z2m_v1.md)
- wirelessly on ZHA: [zha_ota.md](./docs/zha_ota.md)
- by wire: [flashing_via_wire.md](./docs/flashing_via_wire.md)

To switch between End Device and Router, follow [change_device_type.md](./docs/change_device_type.md)
