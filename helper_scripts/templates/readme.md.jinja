# Custom firmware for Tuya switch

A custom firmware for Tuya telink based switch module. Code is based on pvvx's [ZigbeeTLc](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc) firmware, huge thanks!

## Supported devices

Note that rebranded versions may have different internals and may not work. "Zigbee Manufacturer" is the most reliable identifier of the device.

| Z2M device name | Vendor name | Zigbee Manufacturer | Type | Status | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{% for device in devices %}
| [{{device.z2m_device}}](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/{{device.z2m_device}}.html) | {{device.human_name}}  | {{device.tuya_manufacturer_name}} | {{ device.device_types | join(' / ') }} | {{device.status}} |  {% if device.github_issue %} [link]({{device.github_issue}}) {% else %}  - {% endif%} | 
{% endfor %}

If you device is not supported, but it is some Tuya switch module, please check [the porting guide](./docs/porting_to_new_device.md).

## Why?

The main driver for this project was the following factory firmware bug: if one button is pressed, the device ignores clicks to other buttons for ~0.5 seconds. The most frustrating consequence is that pressing both buttons at the same time turns only one relay on.

## Features

- Detached mode, e.g. switch doesn't trigger relay but only generates events via Zigbee
- Bind switch to light bulb
- Long press for momentary switches with configurable duration
- Router/EndDevice modes for no-neutral devices
- Super fast reaction time (compared to the factory firmware)
- 5 quick presses to reset the device
- Power-on behavior 
- Switch modes:  
ON_OFF, OFF_ON, TOGGLE_SIMPLE, TOGGLE_SMART_SYNC, TOGGLE_SMART_OPPOSITE  
allowing to synchonize switch position with relay state

## Building

Only on linux:

```
make install
make
```

## Flashing

Firmware can be [flashed via OTA](./docs/ota_flash.md). If you still use zigbee2mqtt 1.x, use [this guide](./docs/ota_flash_z2m_v1.md)

To switch between End Device and Router follow [this guide](./docs/change_device_type.md)

To flash via wire, follow [this guide](./docs/flashing_via_wire.md)

## Changelog

### v1.0.17

- Fix once again power on behavior = OFF not working if toggle in pressed state during boot

### v1.0.16

- Add new toggle modes: TOGGLE_SMART_SYNC/TOGGLE_SMART_OPPOSITE (requires re-download of `switch_custom.js`)

### v1.0.15

- Add support for Zigbee groups. Read [doc](./docs/endpoints.md) for details about endpoints.

### v1.0.14

- Improve code logic for Indicator LED on for switches

### v1.0.13

- Fix power on behavior = OFF not working if toggle in pressed state during boot
- Add way to control network state led state (requires re-download of `switch_custom.js`)

### v1.0.12

- Fix led indicator state in manual mode not preserved after reboot
- Add forced device announcement after boot to make sure device is seen as "available" as soon as it boots
- Restored device pictures in z2m (requires re-download of `switch_custom.js`)
- Cleaned-up z2m converter (fix typos, inconsistent names, etc). **Warning!** This may break your automations as it changes 
  property names (requires re-download of `switch_custom.js`)

### v1.0.11

- Improve join behaviour by decreasing timeout between tries to join
- Fix leave network: now device will send LeaveNetwork command properly
- Display firmware version in a human-readable form

### v1.0.10

- Add support for bi-stable relays contolled by 2 pins
- Fix Led indicator mode not preserved after reboot

### v1.0.9

- Fix reporting of indicator led status

### v1.0.8

- Add support for indicator leds
- Add way to force momentary mode as default via config

### v1.0.7

- Add SUSPEND-based sleep to EndDevice firmware to decrease power usage ~10x

### v1.0.6

- Add way to change device pinout on the fly, to allow easier porting of firmware 

### v1.0.5

- Keep status LED on when device is connected
- Add separate firmwares for End Device/Router
- Improve device boot time significantly by removing unnecessary logs 

### v1.0.4

- Fix bug that caused report to be sent every second

### v1.0.3

- Add support of statup behaviour: ON, OFF, TOGGLE, PREVIOUS
- Add support of button actions: 'released', 'press', 'long_press'. This is only useful for momentary (doorbell-like) switches.

### v1.0.2

- Add way to reset the device by pressing any switch button 5 times in a row 
- Fix support for ON_OFF, OFF_ON actions
