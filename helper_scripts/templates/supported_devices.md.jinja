# Supported devices

Note that rebranded versions may have different internals, requiring different pinouts (and therefore custom builds).  
**Zigbee Manufacturer** is the most reliable device identifier.

If your device contains a **supported Tuya Zigbee module** (ZTU, ZT2S, ZT3L), porting is relatively simple.  
It consists of tracing (or guessing) the **board pinout**, adding an entry in the `device_db.yaml` file and running the build action.
