# Supported devices

**Z2M device name** usually represents a collection of devices.  
Even if they work the same, rebranded versions have different internals and different pinouts (and therefore require custom builds).  

**Zigbee Manufacturer** is the most reliable unique device identifier. If the TZ3000 id of your device is not on this list, it requires porting. 

For devices that contain a **supported Tuya Zigbee module** (ZTU, ZT2S, ZT3L), porting is relatively simple.  
It consists of tracing (or guessing) the **board pinout**, adding an entry in the `device_db.yaml` file and running the build action.
