We used to think **Zigbee Manufacturer** can reliably indicate a unique device, but AVATTO has proven us wrong.

There are some devices that have different pinouts, **even if their manufacturer names are identical**.  
Please trace the board pinout with a multimeter if your device is on the list below (especially if you bought it from a different source).

If your device has the **default pinout**, you can safely proceed with the update (main branch).  
If your device has a **different pinout**, please request a custom build on the issue page for the respective device.
