# üîì Custom firmware for Telink Tuya switches

Feature-rich custom firmware for Telink-based Tuya switches and switch-modules.  
Code is based on pvvx's [ZigbeeTLc](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc) firmware, huge thanks!

## üîå Supported devices

There are already **25+** [**supported_devices.md**](./docs/supported_devices.md).  
  
> [!TIP]   
> If your device contains a **supported Tuya Zigbee module** (ZT3L, ZTU, ZT2S), porting is relatively simple.  
> It consists of tracing (or guessing) the **board pinout**, adding an entry in `device_db.yaml` and rebuilding. 
>  
> Further reading:  
> [porting_to_new_device.md](./docs/porting_to_new_device.md), [device_db_explained.md](./docs/device_db_explained.md),  
> [recommended_devices.md](./docs/recommended_devices.md), [not_recommended_devices.md](./docs/not_recommended_devices.md).

## ü§î Why?

The main driver for this project was a **frustrating bug in the factory firmware**:  
> When you pressed one button, the device **ignored input from the others** for ~0.5 seconds. As a result, pressing two buttons simultaneously toggled a single relay.

Users also consider this *the missing piece of a reliable smart home* because it allows **using a light switch as a Zigbee remote**.  
> Most of the cheap switches on the market do not allow **binding to other devices out-of-the-box.** 

## ‚ú® Features

- **Super fast reaction time** (compared to stock firmware)
- **Outgoing binds** (use switch to remotely control Zigbee lightbulbs - state & brightness)
- Configurable **Long press** for push-switches (custom action & duration)
- Custom **switch action modes**, allowing to synchonize switch position or binded devices with relay state
- Both **Router** & **EndDevice** modes for no-Neutral devices
- **Detached mode** (generate Zigbee events without triggering relays)
- **Power-on behavior** (on, off, previous, toggle)
- **Wireless flashing and updating** (OTA from original fw to custom fw, further OTA updates)
- Multiple **reset options** (5x switch press, on-board button)

## üì≤ Flashing

The firmware can be installed:
- wirelessly on Z2M: [ota_flash.md](./docs/ota_flash.md) (recommended)
- wirelessly on old Z2M: [ota_flash_z2m_v1.md](./docs/ota_flash_z2m_v1.md)
- wirelessly on ZHA: [zha_ota.md](./docs/zha_ota.md)
- by wire: [flashing_via_wire.md](./docs/flashing_via_wire.md)

> [!TIP]  
> To switch between End Device and Router, follow [change_device_type.md](./docs/change_device_type.md)
